# Project Title

Learning how to use Scrapy with book data taken from [Todostuslibros](http://www.todostuslibros.com) and other sites.

## Description

This project aims to explore different uses of Scrapy to gather book data from several sites that will be added incrementally as independent and/or (possibly) multi-site crawlers. The final objective, besides learning how to use Scrapy, is to build a dataset of book-related information to be used in a separate data analysis and machine learning project.
